I'm a software engineer at Google, currently working on the [:lock: **Asylo**](https://github.com/google/asylo) enclave framework and other confidential computing efforts. I graduated with an honours degree in CS from the [:mortar_board: **University of British Columbia**](https://www.ubc.ca/) in 2019. I also interned at [:punch: **Riot Games**](https://www.riotgames.com/), [:earth_americas: **Google**](https://google.com), and [:bear: **Axiom Zen**](https://www.axiomzen.co/).
