I'm a software engineer from Vancouver, and am currently living and working in Toronto. Previously, I led a product rewrite initiative at [:leafy_green: **Freshline**](https://freshline.io), worked on improving the deliverability of [:mailbox: **Gmail**](https://gmail.com/), and strengthened identity and attestation guarantees around [:lock: **Confidential Computing**](https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing).

I graduated with a CS degree from the [:mortar_board: **University of British Columbia**](https://www.ubc.ca/), and interned at [:punch: **Riot Games**](https://www.riotgames.com/), [:earth_americas: **Google**](https://google.com), and [:bear: **Axiom Zen**](https://www.axiomzen.co/). I also created [:crossed_swords: **zeal.gg**](https://zeal.gg/), a site for tracking the League of Legends ranked climb.
