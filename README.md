I'm a software engineer currently working in Toronto at [:gear:&nbsp;**Relay.app**](https://www.relay.app/), where I'm building AI agents that work for everyone.

Previously, I was the technical lead for a fan engagement platform at [:ice_hockey:&nbsp;**MLSE Digital Labs**](https://www.mlsedigital.com/), led a product rewrite initiative at [:leafy_green:&nbsp;**Freshline**](https://freshline.io), worked on improving the deliverability of [:mailbox:&nbsp;**Gmail**](https://gmail.com/), and strengthened identity and attestation guarantees around [:lock:&nbsp;**Confidential Computing**](https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing).

I graduated with a CS degree from the [:mortar_board:&nbsp;**University of British Columbia**](https://www.ubc.ca/), and interned at [:punch:&nbsp;**Riot Games**](https://www.riotgames.com/), [:earth_americas:&nbsp;**Google**](https://google.com), and [:bear:&nbsp;**Axiom Zen**](https://www.axiomzen.co/). I also created [:crossed_swords:&nbsp;**zeal.gg**](https://zeal.gg/), a site for tracking the League of Legends ranked climb.

Every December, I like to participate in [:christmas_tree:&nbsp;**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com) and try to place on the global leaderboard. My solutions are in [this repository](https://github.com/iKevinY/advent), and my solves can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@iKevinY).

Feel free to reach out to me about software development, computer science education, or video games via [:butterfly:&nbsp;**Bluesky**](https://bsky.app/profile/kevinyap.ca)!
