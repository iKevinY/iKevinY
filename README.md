I'm a software engineer at Google, currently working on the [**Asylo**](https://github.com/google/asylo) enclave framework and other confidential computing efforts. I graduated with an honours degree in CS from the [**University of British Columbia**](https://www.ubc.ca/) in 2019. Prior to graduating, I interned at [**Riot Games**](https://www.riotgames.com/), [**Google**](https://google.com), and [**Axiom Zen**](https://www.axiomzen.co/).

Feel free to reach out to me about software development, computer science education, or video games via [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/iKevinY)!
