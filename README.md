I'm a software engineer at Google working on strengthening identity and attestation guarantees around [Confidential Computing](https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing). I graduated from the [:mortar_board: **University of British Columbia**](https://www.ubc.ca/) with an honours degree in CS, and interned at [:punch: **Riot Games**](https://www.riotgames.com/), [:earth_americas: **Google**](https://google.com), and [:bear: **Axiom Zen**](https://www.axiomzen.co/). I also created [:crossed_swords: **zeal.gg**](https://zeal.gg/), a site for tracking the League of Legends ranked climb.
