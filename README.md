I'm a software engineer from Vancouver, and am currently living and working in Toronto. Right now, I'm a senior backend engineer at [:ice_hockey:&nbsp;**MLSE Digital Labs**](https://www.mlsedigital.com/), where I architect and manage various new products that serve the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors, and more.

Previously, I led a product rewrite initiative at [:leafy_green:&nbsp;**Freshline**](https://freshline.io), worked on improving the deliverability of [:mailbox:&nbsp;**Gmail**](https://gmail.com/), and strengthened identity and attestation guarantees around [:lock:&nbsp;**Confidential Computing**](https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing).

I graduated with a CS degree from the [:mortar_board:&nbsp;**University of British Columbia**](https://www.ubc.ca/), and interned at [:punch:&nbsp;**Riot Games**](https://www.riotgames.com/), [:earth_americas:&nbsp;**Google**](https://google.com), and [:bear:&nbsp;**Axiom Zen**](https://www.axiomzen.co/). I also created [:crossed_swords:&nbsp;**zeal.gg**](https://zeal.gg/), a site for tracking the League of Legends ranked climb.
